This code defines a generator function fibonacci_generator() that yields Fibonacci numbers one by one using the yield keyword.
It starts with two variables, a and b, initialized to 0 and 1 (the first two Fibonacci numbers), and 
continuously updates them in an infinite while True loop to generate the next number in the sequence.
The generator allows efficient, memory-friendly generation of Fibonacci numbers, which can be retrieved one at a time using next().
The example provided prints the first 10 Fibonacci numbers by repeatedly calling the generator in a loop.
